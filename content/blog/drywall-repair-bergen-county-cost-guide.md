## How Much Does Drywall Repair Cost in Bergen County?

If you're a Bergen County homeowner dealing with damaged drywall, one of your first questions is probably about cost. The good news is that most drywall repairs are more affordable than you might expect, and far cheaper than ignoring the problem until it gets worse.

Here's what you can expect to pay for professional drywall repair in Bergen County, NJ in 2026.

## Average Drywall Repair Costs

| Repair Type | Typical Cost Range |
|---|---|
| Small nail holes and dings | $100 – $200 |
| Medium holes (fist-sized) | $150 – $350 |
| Large holes or damaged sections | $250 – $500 |
| Water damage repair | $300 – $600+ |
| Ceiling crack repair | $200 – $450 |
| Plaster wall repair | $250 – $500 |
| Texture matching | $150 – $400 |

Most homeowners in Bergen County pay between **$150 and $500** for a typical drywall repair. The exact cost depends on several factors we'll break down below.

## What Affects the Cost of Drywall Repair?

### Size of the Damage

This is the biggest factor. A small nail hole from hanging a picture takes much less time and material than a large section of water-damaged drywall that needs to be cut out and replaced.

### Location and Accessibility

Ceiling repairs typically cost more than wall repairs because of the overhead work involved. Damage in tight spaces like closets or behind furniture may also add to the cost. If you need [ceiling repair](/services/ceiling-repair/) in a high-ceiling room, scaffolding or specialized equipment may be needed.

### Texture Matching

If your walls have a textured finish like orange peel, knockdown, or skip trowel, matching that texture after a repair requires additional skill and time. Our [texture matching](/services/texture-matching/) specialists ensure the repair blends seamlessly with your existing walls.

### Number of Repairs

Many homeowners save money by bundling multiple repairs into a single visit. If you have several holes or damaged areas throughout your home, getting them all fixed at once is more cost-effective than scheduling separate appointments.

### Paint Matching

Most drywall repairs need to be painted after the patch is complete. Some companies charge extra for [painting and touch-up](/services/painting/), but at The Patch Boys of Bergen County, we can handle the complete job from repair to paint.

## Is Drywall Repair Covered by Insurance?

If your drywall damage was caused by a covered event — like a burst pipe, storm damage, or an accident — your homeowner's insurance may cover the repair cost. Water damage from plumbing failures is commonly covered. However, damage from normal wear and tear, settling cracks, or deferred maintenance is typically not covered.

We recommend documenting the damage with photos and contacting your insurance provider before scheduling repairs. We're happy to provide detailed estimates that you can submit with your claim.
